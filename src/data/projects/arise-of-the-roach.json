  "description": "This was my first game jam. Following some tips from youtube, I focused on building around one fun core loop, spending the first three days refining balance before visuals. All those choices eventually lead to the game being well received, with sound design being the main criticism. It also features an easter egg which I failed to make it clear enough for the player to reach. ",
