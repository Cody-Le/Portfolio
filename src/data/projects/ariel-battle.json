  "description": "This was the first game I ever made, back in middle school. It had one level, no way to close the window, and ended with a Rickroll — yet when I play it now, it’s surprisingly fun and dynamic. I still remember showing it to my friends; their reactions, from frustration to laughter, sparked the desire that eventually brought me back to game development after years away.",
