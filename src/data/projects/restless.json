  "description": "Restless was meant to apply everything I’d learned so far — and in many ways, I failed. Instead of focusing on the fun, I got caught up in the game’s aesthetics. Still, I quickly learned the PBR Blender pipeline and used it to create striking visuals by overlaying 2D characters on top of 3D environments. The result was the best-looking game I’ve ever made, all while running smoothly on the web.",
