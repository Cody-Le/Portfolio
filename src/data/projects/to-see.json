  "description": "To See was the first game I led for the Game Builders Club at UGA. It was a humbling experience managing a team of eight and trying to bring a shared vision to life. Although the story foundation was solid, real-life challenges slowed progress, and we fell significantly short of the original goal. The result was visually impressive, but I lacked the game design fundamentals to make it truly fun â€” a lesson that reshaped how I approach leadership and development.",
