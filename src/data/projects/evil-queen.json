  "description": "I had a strong concept for this jam, but the execution fell short. The game required seven sets of dwarf animations plus multiple attack patterns for the queen, and the art quickly became a bottleneck. I spent too much time there and lost sight of the core loop, which ended up feeling unintuitive and unbalanced — with unclear telegraphs and overwhelming attacks. I didn’t realize how much theory I was missing until later projects like Hockey, Horse, and Dragon, where I finally began learning what makes a game truly fun.",
