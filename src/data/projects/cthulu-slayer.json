  "description": "This was my second time leading a team for the Game Builders Club, with around 11 members. Building on my experience from To See, I was able to define a more realistic scope for the project. I also experimented with state machines, vertical file organization, and sprint-based development. The final product was unpolished, but it met the goals we set at the start of the semester â€” a solid step forward in both management and technical direction.",
