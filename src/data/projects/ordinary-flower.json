  "description": "The game was made in three days, where I experimented with using a core loop scene and Godotâ€™s inheritance system to adapt it for storytelling. The result was a short game that successfully conveyed the story and tone I had in mind. This approach to using inherited scenes later became a foundation for larger projects like Trembling Steppes.",
