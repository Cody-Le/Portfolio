  "description": "Dragon of the East was made for the Boss Rush Game Jam. I originally planned three bosses and levels but decided to focus entirely on one—to make the dragon feel as close as possible to the vision I had in my head. The result was a striking, high-ranking boss encounter that I was proud of, but I made it far too difficult. After beating it countless times myself, I overestimated the player’s skill. It taught me the importance of balancing ambition with accessibility and testing beyond my own experience.",
